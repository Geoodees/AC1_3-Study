# AC1_3-Study

Check the documentation to get a quick intro to LabJS, try to play around a little with the examples
https://labjs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/learn/builder/

To keep on working,

1. Open the editor, https://labjs.felixhenninger.com/
2. Import the json-file by choosing Study -> Open
3. When you are done, just click save and you will get a json-file back

When working, make sure to create your own branch before doing anything.

## Basic commands
You can pick to work in the GUI or from a terminal. I will just list the basic command line actions, and you can search how they work.

## Pulls and Pushes
The basic way of starting to work with code, or adding/changing files is by pulling or pushing. You pull to get the files, and push to add files.

If you work from the GUI, you can pretty much download any files needed directly. Then add the files manually afterwards.

## Creating a branch
A branch is your own code enviroment. Any changes they you do, stays in your branch! When you feel happy about your work, you can then MERGE it into the master branch, combining two files into one.

Here is a guide on how to create your own branch,
